What did you like about this project?

It really allows me to stretch my limits and understand my technically skill better, and I like how we are given ample time as we are still beginners.

What did you struggle with in this project?

I feel like I am still not up to standard yet, I thought I was good enough, especially with flexbox, I realised that I am not really proficient in it yet.

What would make your experience with this assessment better?
I feel that maybe we could have more practice like a set of ten-year-series of questions that can really let us understand what proficiency level are we at.
